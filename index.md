# dd

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dd is to provide documentation for DuckDB's functions, and later also an easy way to test them.
It is meant to be used in conjunction with [duckplyr](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/r).


## Installation

You can install the development version of dd like so:

``` r
pak::pak("krlmlr/dd")
```

## Example


``` r
library(dd)
dd$acos
#> function(x = DOUBLE) {
#>   stop("DuckDB function acos() is not available in R.")
#> }
#> <bytecode: 0xdeadbeef>
#> <environment: namespace:dd>
help(acos, package = "dd")
```

```
DuckDB function acos

Description:

     Computes the arccosine of x.

Arguments:

       x: 'DOUBLE'

Examples:

     ## Not run:
     
     acos(0.5)
     ## End(Not run)
     
```
